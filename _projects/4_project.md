Embracing the intersection of my artistic passion and academic journey. 
During my Ph.D., I had the pleasure of designing the impactful  <a href="http://vandal.polito.it/" target="_blank">Vandal </a> Lab logo and crafting two dynamic roll-up banners for our research group.

In the next part, I fused my love for drawing with another interest of mine—basketball. 
I put my creative touch into designing uniforms for my basketball squad, Sporting Coguaro.
